bean = {
    inputs
      [list] List of filenames of .nxs scan files

    output
      [str] Output filename - must be in processing directory, or somewhere you can write to

    outputMode
      [str] Type of output generated, see below for options

    splitterName
      [str] one of the following strings "nearest", "gaussian", "negexp", "inverse"

    splitterParameter
      [float] splitter's parameter is distance to half-height of the weight function.
      If you use None or "" then it is treated as "nearest"

    scaleFactor
      [float] the oversampling factor for each image; to ensure that are no gaps in between pixels in mapping

    monitorName
      [str] sets the monitor to normalise by "rc", "ic1monitor"

    correctPolarization
      [bool] Set true to correct for polarization factor caused by transformation from laboratory frame to scattering plane

    region
      [sx, ex, sy, ey] Set rectangular region that defines the area with its bounds that contribute to output

    step
      [float, list] a single value or list if 3 values and determines the lengths of each side of the voxels in the volume

    start
      [list] location in HKL space of the bottom corner of the array.

    shape
      [list] size of the array to create for reciprocal space volume

    reduceToNonZero
      [bool] if True, attempts to reduce the volume output
}
